# Web Page Design Project

## 📖 Introduction
This project involves building a complete web page from scratch based on a provided design. The design consists of two images:  
1. **Full Design** – a complete mockup of the website.  
2. **Colors & Fonts** – details about typography and color schemes.  

The goal is to practice structuring a website, styling with CSS, and replicating a professional layout. Precision is not the main focus—getting close to the design while building a solid foundation is what matters most.

## 💡 Tips
- Don’t hesitate to use **Google** or revisit lessons. Developers reference documentation constantly.  
- Small design details can be looked up (e.g., *“CSS rounded corners”*).  
- Have fun! Personalize the project with your own content, images, and styles if you’d like.
